# Grand Theft Auto III Console

* Testing some assembly studies. 
* Added a basic memory patch test, Instructions can be rewrote in cheat engines assembler. I got the hex bytes and wrote them with writeproccessmemory. Adds opcode instructions in return

* I will be getting into "HeapAlloc" soon. Something I should really advance in for something like this.

* "This isn't something fancy yet, just a base entry for assembly for Grand Theft Auto III"
